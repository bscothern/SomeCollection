    ///   - genericName: When specified this will be used instead of `Element` as the name of the assoicatedtype of the `where` clause.
    ///   - isLazy: Can be used to explicitly mark the `Sequence` as lazy or not.
    ///       If it is not specified by providing `nil` then this property is synthesized as the value of `name.contains("Lazy")`
